# ThiagoCruzRJ's Cloud Computing Blog

Welcome to my personal blog on [GitHub Pages](https://thiagocruzrj.github.io/), where I share insights, tutorials, and best practices on Cloud Computing. This blog focuses on topics such as Azure, AWS, Kubernetes, DevOps, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Blog Structure

The blog is organized as follows:

- **_posts/**: This folder contains all the blog posts in Markdown format. Each file is named with the date and topic of the post, following the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-Title-of-Post.md`.
